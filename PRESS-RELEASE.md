# CrewBuilder #

### Build and cultivate a street team for grass-roots support ###

## Vision ##
  > A social community app for gamifying group involvement.

## Summary ##
  > CrewBuilder is a platform to bring together organizers (CrewLeaders) and contributors (CrewMembers) to accomplish goals of the organization by rewarding completion of Crew Tasks.

## Problem ##
  > Many worthwhile organizations, causes, and events need a support base to accomplish and further their goals.

## Solution ##
  > CrewBuilder helps organizers get high-priority tasks completed by gamifying the volunteer experience. This creates a sort of rewards program for your Crew's supporters and can convert a 'willing-to-contribute' base to a 'actively-contributing' base.
